## Model introduction

In this project, we introduce a brain functional connectivity matrix that is fine-tuned by reinforcement learning and reconstructed from fMRI data, and used to generate a picture of the brain functional connectivity matrix over time
The specific modeling process of the model is shown in the documentation.ipynb
